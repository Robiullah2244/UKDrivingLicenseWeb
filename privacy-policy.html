  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="updated">Last Updated: Jan 14, 2026</div>

  <p>
    Our driving license learning app is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we collect and how it may be used.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>
    Our app offers users the option to log in using their Google account, or Apple ID. This login functionality is provided to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Track and sync study progress across sessions or devices</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The information collected through these login methods (such as authentication tokens) is used solely for these purposes and is <strong>not shared with third parties</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Our app uses third-party services to serve advertisements and collect usage analytics. These services may collect and process data such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA/GAID)</li>
    <li>App usage data (e.g., session durations, screen views)</li>
    <li>User interactions with ads</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for displaying ads and handling consent under the EU User Consent Policy</li>
    <!-- <li><strong>AppLovin</strong> – for delivering personalized and non-personalized ads</li>
    <li><strong>Liftoff (formerly Vungle)</strong> – for video ads and engagement tracking</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> – for understanding how users interact with the app</li> -->
  </ul>

  <h2>Consent and Data Transparency</h2>
  <p>
    For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, and Switzerland, we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) SDK to request your consent for storing and accessing information on your device (IAB TCF Purpose 1).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you give consent, it also applies to analytics purposes. This allows Firebase Analytics to track user behavior, such as screen views and session activity, to help us improve the app. Consent signals are automatically shared with Google services under Google’s Consent Mode.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may change or withdraw your consent at any time through the app settings.
  </p>

  <p>Third-party privacy policies:</p>

    <!-- <li><a href="https://www.applovin.com/privacy/" target="_blank">AppLovin Privacy Policy</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://liftoff.io/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">Liftoff (Vungle) Privacy Policy</a></li> -->
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention and Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take the security of your information seriously and apply appropriate measures to protect it. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee complete security.
  </p>

  <h2>Premium (Monthly) — Subscription Terms</h2>
  <p><strong>Premium (Monthly)</strong> is an <strong>auto-renewable subscription</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment will be charged to your <strong>Apple ID</strong> at confirmation of purchase.</li>
    <li>The subscription <strong>automatically renews</strong> unless auto-renew is turned off at least <strong>24 hours</strong> before the end of the current period.</li>
    <li>Charges may occur up to <strong>24 hours</strong> before the renewal date.</li>
    <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription in iOS: <strong>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</strong>.</li>
    <li>Refunds are handled by <strong>Apple</strong> and are subject to Apple's eligibility decisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal or operational reasons. Any updates will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be modified accordingly.
